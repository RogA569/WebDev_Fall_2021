		Even though this reading was incredibly dense, I think its main ideas are incredibly applicable to today's world. I think it's worth understanding how integrated we are to our technologies. We assume that these developing technologies of communication possess the same beneficial social foundations that things such as the telephone had. However, these technologies have introduced a paradigm in which we have lost both our traditional sense of interaction intimacy and our sense of self. That should be something we should keep in mind, so that we may desire for a new kind of desire along with the emergence of technology. Perhaps this social impetus, of wanting a new social impetus, could drive this change.
