<!-- Roger: I was thinking of slapping a rotating texture onto the button surface. The button itself would look 3-dimensional, but definitely that isn't set in stone if we can't accomplish it. -->

<!-- Nick: My idea was to create a button that 'hides' every time you click it or makes it harder to click, maybe using on hover actions. Either way, I'm down to do anything, so message me on Discord or send me a reply so we can bounce ideas. -->
