	<h1> The Concept </h1>
	<p> The concept of my final project revolves around cookies, specifically the ones that our computers always receive from all the websites we visit (so generous!) 
	</p>
	<p> Cookies are not a bad thing or a good thing. Like many things about the Internet (as we have learned throughout this semester), something that starts out as neutral can be a boon and a drawback.
	</p>
	<p> I will create a giant chocolate chip cookie (in 3D, using Blender/three.js) that gets “eaten” (with relevant sound effects) as the user scrolls down (à la Apple’s one-page scrolling websites). Once the cookie is fully “eaten”, two links will appear, which are about Google’s delaying on its removal of third-party cookies.
